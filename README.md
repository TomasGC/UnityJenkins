# UnityJenkins
A draft of a config for Jenkins to create Unity builds/asset bundles and deploy them.

I exposed those in order to help Unity Developers who would like to have a CI but don't know how to set it up.
Of course it's not perfect, I didn't know how to set up entirely Jenkins before doing that, I still have a lot to learn.
Anyway, this draft will not work as you will have to change some values and probably readapt it for you own project.

In any cases, if you need help, don't hesitate to contact me and I'll try to help you. ;)
